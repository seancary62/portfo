                  <h3>Origin Story</h3>
                  <p>Hi, I'm Sean Cary, a data analyst with a background in mechanical engineering. I am passionate about leveraging data to drive positive change in philanthropic projects, as well as exploring various topics such as fitness, finance, and more.

                    In 2013, I graduated from UNC Charlotte with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, which equipped me with a strong foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking. However, my curiosity for data analysis led me to pursue further education. In 2021, I completed a data analytics bootcamp through UNC Charlotte, honing my skills in extracting insights from data and applying them to real-world scenarios.
                    
                    Throughout my journey, I have undertaken diverse projects that showcase my abilities as a data analyst. One of my notable projects involved developing a fitness-focused tool for athletes with ambitious goals. By scraping NFL Combine data using BeautifulSoup and visualizing it in PowerBI, I was able to extract valuable insights that informed and enhanced my personal workout plan.
                    
                    Additionally, I embarked on a captivating project to gather and chronologically sort historical movies. Using Python, I accessed movie data through an API, performed necessary transformations, and visualized the results in Tableau. This endeavor involved handling over 700 movies, providing me with a fascinating perspective on the evolution of cinema. As an avid movie enthusiast, I've watched 25 of the included films, fostering a deep appreciation for the art of storytelling.
                    
                    Beyond my technical pursuits, I hold a personal mission statement that guides my actions and aspirations. I strive for humbleness, fortitude, and respect, always aiming to be the best version of myself. I am driven by both personal success and the desire to empower others to achieve greatness. For me, values like hard work, collaboration, and empathy are fundamental in attaining meaningful goals.
                    
                    Outside of my professional endeavors, I enjoy indulging in high-adrenaline sports, coding for fun, exploring the world of movies, delving into world history, and immersing myself in the epic saga of Star Wars (some scenes from Return of the Jedi were filmed in the Redwood National Forest).
                    
                    Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am excited about the prospect of applying my skills and passion for data to make a positive impact in the world. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to unlock the potential of data together.</p>
