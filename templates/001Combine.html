  <h3>Introduction:</h3>
  <p>The purpose of this portfolio project was to develop a tool to help athletes assess their potential performance in the NFL Combine based on their size. The project involved scraping NFL Combine data spanning from 1987 to 2023 using BeautifulSoup and Python. The data was then cleaned and processed to extract valuable insights, which were visualized using PowerBI.</p>
  
  <h3>Data Collection and Cleaning:</h3>
  <p>Using web scraping techniques, the project retrieved comprehensive NFL Combine data, including various performance metrics, from the specified time range. BeautifulSoup was employed to extract the necessary information from the web pages. Subsequently, Python was utilized to clean and preprocess the data, ensuring its accuracy and reliability for analysis.</p>
  
  <h3>Insights and Findings:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h4>Athlete Size and 40 Yard Dash Time:</h4>
      <p>Focused on athletes with a height range of 71-73" and weight range of 198-203lbs, the project examined the 40 Yard dash time. The analysis revealed a minimum time of 4.28s, an average of 4.56s, and a maximum of 5.14s for athletes of this size.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Temporal Trends:</h4>
      <p>Comparing data from 1987 to the present, it was observed that the average 40 Yard dash time has decreased by 2.5%, indicating an overall improvement in athlete performance over time.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Positional Performance:</h4>
      <p>Among the positions assessed, the Defensive Back (DB) category exhibited the highest overall performance. However, it should be noted that only three athletes were listed under this position. The Corner Back (CB) position also demonstrated strong performance, with 1406 players included in the analysis.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Top Performers:</h4>
      <p>Jerick McKinnon from Southern Georgia emerged as the most well-rounded player when considering performance across all events. His consistent performance across multiple metrics distinguished him as a standout athlete.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Plyo/Speed Score:</h4>
      <p>Byron Jones achieved the highest Plyo/Speed Score, which excludes the bench press. This metric highlights his exceptional performance in the specified categories, emphasizing his athleticism and explosiveness.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>School Performance:</h4>
      <p>Analyzing larger schools with over 200 participating players, Ohio State emerged as the dominant institution across most events, except for the bench press (led by Michigan) and the 40 Yard dash (led by Miami).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Correlations:</h4>
      <p>Positive correlations were observed between high scores on the 3 Cone, Shuttle, Broad Jump, Vertical Leap, and Shuttle drills with faster 40 Yard dash times. Conversely, higher numbers in Bench Press, Weight, and Height were associated with slower 40 Yard times. However, noteworthy exceptions, such as Calvin Johnson's exceptional performance, indicate that individual skill and talent can overcome these general trends.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Conclusion: </h3>
  <p>In this portfolio project I developed a tool to help athletes determine their potential performance in the NFL Combine based on their size. By scraping and analyzing data from 1987 to 2023, valuable insights were uncovered, highlighting temporal trends, positional performance, individual achievements, and school dominance. The project's findings contribute to a better understanding of athlete performance in the NFL Combine and can aid athletes in their preparations and aspirations for professional football. </p>
